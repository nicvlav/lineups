# Auto-Balance Randomization Fix

## Issue
The new implementation was too deterministic - always filling positions in the same priority order, leading to:
- Same team compositions every time
- No variety in position assignments
- Predictable results

## Solution
Restored the original's randomization strategy while keeping our improvements:

### Zone-Based Random Selection
```typescript
// RANDOMIZATION: Pick a random zone to fill (like original)
const randomZone = availableZones[Math.floor(Math.random() * availableZones.length)];
```

### How It Works Now

1. **Random Zone Selection**: Randomly picks which zone (GK/DEF/MID/ATT) to fill next
2. **Priority Within Zone**: Still respects position priorities within the selected zone
3. **Best Player for Position**: Still uses our improved sorting to find the best player
4. **Variety in Results**: Different team compositions even with same players

### Randomization Points

1. **Formation Selection**: Random formation from available templates
2. **Zone Selection**: Random zone to fill each iteration
3. **Same-Priority Positions**: Slight randomization between positions with same priority

### Benefits

- **Variety**: Multiple runs produce different but valid team compositions
- **Fairness**: Prevents always favoring certain positions
- **Realism**: More like how real coaches might shuffle lineups
- **Monte Carlo**: Better exploration of solution space

## Algorithm Flow

```
While players remain:
  1. Pick random zone (0-3) that has open positions
  2. Within that zone, fill positions by priority
  3. For each position, use smart sorting to find best player
  4. Assign player and update balances
  5. Repeat
```

## Preserved Improvements

All efficiency improvements remain:
- ✅ Specialist detection and prioritization
- ✅ Efficiency-based sorting
- ✅ Position mismatch penalties
- ✅ Enhanced debug output

## Result

The algorithm now produces varied, high-quality team compositions that:
- Change between runs (randomization)
- Still prioritize specialists (smart sorting)
- Maintain good efficiency (proper weights)
- Create balanced teams (Monte Carlo optimization)
