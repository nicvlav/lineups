# Sports Team Lineup Generator

## Overview
The **Sports Team Lineup Generator** is a web-based application designed to help users create, manage, and customize sports team formations. Users can add players, assign them to positions, and modify lineups dynamically using a simple drag-and-drop interface.

## Features
- **Player Management**: Create and maintain a list of players.
- **Custom Formations**: Arrange players into formations for various sports.
- **Interactive Field**: Drag players onto the field to assign positions.
- **Dynamic Role Switching**: Double-click players on the field to toggle between main and guest roles.
- **Position Adjustments**: Drag player icons within the field to rearrange positions easily.
- **Generate Balanced Teams**: Automatically generate balanced teams based on adjustable zone weights.
- **Session Persistence**: Uses IndexedDB to cache tabs for session continuity.
- **Sharable Links**: Packs all game data into the URL for easy sharing without external storage.
- **Privacy-Conscious**: No data is stored on a server; all data remains local to the user.

## Deployment
The app is hosted and available at:
ðŸ”— [https://lineups.nicolasvlavianos.workers.dev](https://lineups.nicolasvlavianos.workers.dev)

## Installation & Setup
### Prerequisites
You can use Bun or npm to install and run the project.
- **[Bun](https://bun.sh/)** (Recommended)
- **[Node.js 16+](https://nodejs.org/)** 


### Install Dependencies
Using Bun:
```sh
bun install
```

Using npm:
```sh
npm install
```

### Start Development Server
Using Bun:
```sh
bun dev
```

Using npm:

```

The frontend will now be running at the URL provided in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:5173/`).

## How It Works
1. **Add Players**: Create a list of players that can be assigned to formations.
2. **Drag & Drop Players**: Move players from the sidebar into the field to set up a formation.
3. **Adjust Player Positions**: Click and drag players within the field to reposition them.
4. **Switch Player Roles**: Double-click a player to toggle between main and guest status.
5. **Modify Formations**: Experiment with different setups to optimize your teamâ€™s strategy.
6. **Generate Balanced Teams**: Assign players automatically using weighted attributes (attack, defense, athleticism) that add up to 1.
7. **Session Caching**: IndexedDB ensures tabs retain session data locally, even after refreshes.
8. **Share Your Setup**: The entire game state is encoded into the URL, making it easy to share formations with others.
    - No URL shortener is used by default to ensure transparency and data control.
    - Since no external storage is used, there is no persistent data collection.

## Methods to Add Players to the Session
1. **Sidebar Add Button**: Click the sidebar, then click "Add Player," enter a name, and click "Add."
2. **Header Players Button**: Click the "Players" header icon button (or just the icon on mobile), type a player name, and click "Add Player."
3. **In-Game Quick Add**: When opening the player actions menu (double-click on desktop, click and hold on mobile), type a new playerâ€™s name to add them to the game instantly.

## Methods to Add Players to Teams
1. **Sidebar Context Menu**: Open the sidebar and right-click (desktop) or click and hold (mobile) on a player to send them to a team.
2. **Drag & Drop (Wide Mode Only)**: Click and drag a player onto the desired team. This feature is unavailable on smaller screen widths.
3. **Formation Auto-Fill**: Click "Formations" in the sidebar to fill teams with existing players. Missing players are replaced with temporary ones. Then, open player actions (double-click on desktop, click and hold on mobile) to swap or add players.
4. **Generate Balanced Teams**: Click the "Generate" header icon button, select players using the checkbox list, and hit "Generate Two Teams." This automatically forms optimally balanced teams based on player stats.
    - Each time you generate, it introduces slight randomization for variety.
